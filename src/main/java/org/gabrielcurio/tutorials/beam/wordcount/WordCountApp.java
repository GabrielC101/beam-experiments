/**
 * An example that counts words in Shakespeare and includes Beam best practices.
 *
 * <p>This class, {@link WordCountApp}, is the second in a series of four successively more detailed
 * 'word count' examples. You may first want to take a look at {@link MinimalWordCount}. After
 * you've looked at this example, then see the {@link DebuggingWordCount} pipeline, for introduction
 * of additional concepts.
 *
 * <p>For a detailed walkthrough of this example, see <a
 * href="https://beam.apache.org/get-started/wordcount-example/">
 * https://beam.apache.org/get-started/wordcount-example/ </a>
 *
 * <p>Basic concepts, also in the MinimalWordCount example: Reading text files; counting a
 * PCollection; writing to text files
 *
 * <p>New Concepts:
 *
 * <pre>
 *   1. Executing a Pipeline both locally and using the selected runner
 *   2. Using ParDo with static DoFns defined out-of-line
 *   3. Building a composite transform
 *   4. Defining your own pipeline options
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>Concept #1: you can execute this pipeline either locally or using by selecting another runner.
 * These are now command-line options and not hard-coded as they were in the MinimalWordCount
 * example.
 *
 * <p>To change the runner, specify:
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * --runner=YOUR_SELECTED_RUNNER
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <p>To execute this pipeline, specify a local output file (if using the {@code DirectRunner}) or
 * output prefix on a supported distributed file system.
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * --output=[YOUR_LOCAL_FILE | YOUR_OUTPUT_PREFIX]
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <p>The input file defaults to a public data set containing the text of of King Lear, by William
 * Shakespeare. You can override it and choose your own input with {@code --inputFile}.
